  description: "Advancing racial justice through research, advocacy and journalism.  The Applied Research Center (ARC) understands that pressing political conflicts demand a serious treatment of racial equity that addresses both a history of injustice and contemporary problems. We see racism, and demand concrete change from our most powerful public institutions to build a fair and equal society. ARC's vision for racial justice is changing the way our society talks about and understands racial inequity. ARC conducts resarch to expose the subtle racism of laws and regulations that result in real hardship for Black, Latino, Asian and Native communities."
