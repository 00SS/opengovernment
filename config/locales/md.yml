In 2010, the legislature was only in regular session -- meaning, where bills are introduced and voted on -- from Jan. 13th - April 12th. As a result, while the legislature still holds committee meetings through the end of the year, the bills below will not have any more official actions.<br><br>
            A new Maryland state legislature will convene in January 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced and appear here automatically. Until then, you can use the sort-by options below to view the most-current bills in different ways.

                        makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.
