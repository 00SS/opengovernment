        This is a list of all bills in the Texas state legislature. By state law, the legislature is only in 'regular session'
        (meaning, where bills are introduced and voted on) for a period of 140 days every two years. The current 81st Texas
        legislature was in regular session from approx. March to July of 2009, and while committee hearings are
        scheduled periodically through the end of 2010, the legislature will generally not take any more actions on the bills below.
        
        A new Texas state legislature, the 82nd, will convene on Jan. 11th, 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced
        and appear here automatically. Until then, you can use the sort-by options below to view bills in different ways.

  issues:
    index:
      intro: |
        This is a list of issue areas associated with legislation in the Texas state legislature.
        The Texas legislature assigns official 'subjects' to bills -- sometimes more than twenty subjects per bill,
        sometimes zero. These subjects, which total 6,039 in
        the current 81st TX legislature, are sometimes very specific and other times very broad. To make this
        bill-to-issue system more accessible, we manually matched up every official subject with one of the below 46
        legislative issue areas, as generated by the non-partisan Project VoteSmart. The result is that all of the below
        issue areas have many hundreds of TX state bills attached, with most bills attached to more than one issue area. Our
        goal is to make it easier to find bills that are relevant to the real-world issues you care
        about, while still making the raw subect information available for those with specific interest areas. The TX
        legislature is currently not in regular session, meaning that there will be no further bills added to the issue
        areas below. The next TX legislature will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which date new bills will be
        introduced and will appear here automatically under our customized issue area categories. Until then, you can
        learn more about issues and bills from this legislature by using the sort-by options below.

        This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the TX state
        legislature. Data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
        agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports. The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
        makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, issue areas, and campaign contributions in state legislatures.<br>
        The next election for the Texas legislature (for all 150 Assemblymembers and half of the 32 Senators) will occur on Nov. 2, 2010.
        The newly-elected legislature will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
        contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from this session by viewing the three tiers of contributions listed below: sectors,
        industries, and businesses. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics.
