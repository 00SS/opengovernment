      intro: "This is a list of all bills in the Texas state legislature. The TX legislature is only in 'regular session' (meaning, where bills are inroduced and voted on) for a period of 140 days every two years. The current 81st TX legislature was in regular session from approx. March to July of 2009, and while committee hearings are scheduled periodically through the end of 2010, the bills listed below will have no further official actions. A new TX legislature (the 82nd) will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced and appear here automatically. Until then, you can learn more about bills from this past session by using the sort-by options below to view bills in different ways -- for example, by most in the news, or those with 'key votes' as determined by the non-partisn Project Vote Smart."

  issues: 
    index: 
      intro: "This is a list of issue areas associated with legislation in the Texas state legislature. The TX legislature assigns official 'subjects' to bills -- sometimes more than a dozen subjects per bill, sometimes zero per bill, with no clear explanation of their methodology. These subjects, which total 6,039 in the current 81st TX legislature, can sometimes be very specific, and sometimes very broad. To make this bill-to-issue system more widely accessible, we manually matched up every subject with one of the below 46 legislative issue areas, as defined by the non-partisan Project VoteSmart. The result is that all of the below issue areas have many hundreds of bills attached, with most bills attached to more than one issue area. Our goal with this effort is to make it easier to find bills that are relevant to the real-world issues you care about, while still making the raw subect information available for those with more niche interests. The TX legislature is currently not in regular session, meaning that there will be no further bills added to the issue areas below. The next TX legislature will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced and will appear here automatically under our refined issue area categories. Until then, you can learn more about  bills and issues from this past session by using the sort-by options below to view issues in different ways -- for example, by most-viewed."

      intro: "This is all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the TX state legislature. Data comes from the non-partisanFollowTheMoney, which receives its data from the state disclosure agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports. The Money Trail on OpenGovernment makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, issues, and campaign contributions. The next election (for all 150 Assemblymembers and half of the 32 Senators) will occur on Nov. 2, 2010. The newly-elected TX legislature will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can learn more about the money trail from this past session by viewing contributions by the three tiers listlisted below: sectors, industries, and businesses."
