        This is a list of all bills in the current 2009 - 2010 Wisconsin state legislature. <!--In 2010, the legislature was only in regular session -- meaning, where bills are introduced and voted on -- from Jan. 19th - April 22nd. As a result, while committee meetings are scheduled through the end of the year, the bills below will not have any more official actions.--> The next legislature will convene in January 2011, after which date newly introduced bills will appear here automatically.<br><br>
        Bill pages display official government information combined with news coverage, blog posts, and more to help make them more accessible.

  issues:
    index:
      intro: |
        This is a list of all issue areas -- here referred to as "subjects" -- for legislation in the Wisconsin state legislature. State legislatures generate many thousands of subjects every regular session and officially assign them to individual legislative items -- sometimes many subjects per bill, sometimes zero. <br><br> To make this bill-to-issue system more intelligible, the first list below is the 46 major legislative issue areas as determined by the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a>. With volunteer <a href="/pages/help">help</a>, we seek to manually match every official bill subject to one of the below 46 issue areas. The resulting info on OpenGovernment will make it far easier to find bills that are relevant to the real-world political issues you care about. Until that project is completed, below that list on this page is displayed the most-frequent bill subjects in Wisconsin, those that are applied to bills ten or more times. Click the link to "view all" subjects to see the full list of many thousands of individual, idiosyncratic bill subjects and their associated bills.<br><br>
               The next Wisconsin legislature will convene in January 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced and appear here automatically under our customized issue area categories. Until then, use the sort-by options below to view issues and bills from the most recent legislature in different ways.

        This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Wisconsin state
                              legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                              agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                              The newly-elected CA legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                              contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                             <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.<br><br> The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
                                makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.bills:
