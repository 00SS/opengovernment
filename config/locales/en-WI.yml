        <em>Editorial note</em>: Wisconsin does fairly well in making video re: legislation in state government available on their site <a href="http://www.wiseye.org/legislature0910a.html" target="_blank">Wisconsin Eye</a>, although unfortunately the videos are published in the problematic Windows Media Format. While their site's web design compares favorably with those of the other four state legislatures in this beta version of OpenGovernment, the WI leg. still does not appear to make their video accessible in ways that are fully automatic (i.e., over API or for bulk download) or libre (i.e., freely-licensed) or via open standards (e.g., a video RSS feed of videos in an open-source file format).

      intro: |
        The bill "subjects" below are officially assigned to legislation by the Wisconsin state legislature. Individual subjects can be very broad, or very specific, and are applied to bills using an unclear methodology -- sometimes more than a dozen subjects per bill, sometimes none.<br><br>
        In the future, to make bills in Wisconsin more intelligible, we seek to map every subject to one of the 46 legislative issue areas defined by the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a> -- read more about <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>. Until then, below we're displaying the most-frequently used subjects in the Wisconsin legislature, those applied to bills four times or more.<br><br>                
        The next Wisconsin legislature will convene in January 2011, after which date new subjects will be introduced and appear here automatically as they are applied to bills.

        This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Wisconsin state
                              legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                              agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                              The newly-elected Wisconsin legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                              contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,

                                makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.bills:
