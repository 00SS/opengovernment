         How did we get the above information? Well, the Wisconsin legislature does not make its data available in ways that are fully open, but we worked around it. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

While their site's overall design compares favorably with those of the other four state legislatures in this beta version of OpenGovernment, the Wisconsin legislature still does not appear to make their video accessible in ways that comply with the community-generated <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/" target="_blank">Principles of Open Gov Data</a>.

While their site's web design compares favorably with those of the other four state legislatures in this beta version of OpenGovernment, the WI leg. still does not appear to make their video accessible in ways that are fully automatic (i.e., over API or for bulk download) or libre (i.e., freely-licensed) or via open standards (e.g., a video RSS feed of videos in an open-source file format).

      intro: |
         The Wisconsin state legislature does not assign issue areas to legislation. As a workaround, OpenGovernment editors will work to manually assign one or more of the 46 legislative issue areas from the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a> to major bills in the Wisconsin legislature. We seek to make bills more widely intelligible -- read <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>.

        This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Wisconsin state
                              legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                              agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                              The newly-elected Wisconsin legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                              contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                             <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.<br><br> The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
                                makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.bills:
