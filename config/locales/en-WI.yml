         ... this free public resource is still in early development -- many more data & features are still to come, and you can <strong><a href="/pages/help">help us grow</a></strong>.<br><br>
         How did we get the above information? Well, the Wisconsin legislature does not make its data available in ways that are fully open, but we worked around it. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

        <em>Editorial note</em>: Wisconsin does fairly well in making video regarding state legislation available on their site <a href="http://www.wiseye.org/legislature0910a.html" target="_blank">Wisconsin Eye</a>, although unfortunately the videos are published in the closed Windows Media format. While their site's overall design compares favorably with those of the other four state legislatures in this beta version of OpenGovernment, the Wisconsin legislature still does not appear to make their video accessible in ways that comply with the community-generated <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/" target="_blank">Principles of Open Gov Data</a>.

        <em>Editorial note</em>: Wisconsin does fairly well in making video re: members of state government available on their site <a href="http://www.wiseye.org/legislature0910a.html" target="_blank">Wisconsin Eye</a>, although unfortunately the videos are published in the problematic Windows Media Format. While their site's web design compares favorably with those of the other four state legislatures in this beta version of OpenGovernment, the WI leg. still does not appear to make their video accessible in ways that are fully automatic (i.e., over API or for bulk download) or libre (i.e., freely-licensed) or via open standards (e.g., a video RSS feed of videos in an open-source file format).
