          How did we get the above information? Well, the Texas legislature does not make its data available in ways that are fully open, but we worked around it. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

        <em>Editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now for video on bills in Texas, the state legislature offers fairly extensive audio & video archives on pages for the <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/bin/live.php" target="_blank">Senate</a> and <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/video-audio/" target="_blank">House of Representatives</a>, though in the terribly out-of-date "Real Media" video format. As best we can tell, the Texas legislature does not make video accessible automatically (i.e., over API or for bulk download) or libre (i.e., freely-licensed) or via open standards (e.g., a video RSS feed of videos in an open-source file format). So at the moment, a fair amount of research and digging is still required to access video content relevant to this bill and bills in general.

      intro: |
       This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Texas state
                 legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                 agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
         The Money Trail makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations. This open resource is intended to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics and mitigate systemic corruption in state government. There are three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>, <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.
