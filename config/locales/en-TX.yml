      intro: |
        This is a list of all bills in the Texas state legislature. By state law, the legislature is only in 'regular session'
        (meaning, where bills are introduced and voted on) for a period of 140 days every two years. The current 81st Texas
        legislature was in regular session from approx. March to July of 2009, and while committee hearings are
        scheduled periodically through the end of 2010, the legislature will generally not take any more actions on the bills below.
        
        A new Texas state legislature, the 82nd, will convene on Jan. 11th, 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced
        and appear here automatically. Until then, you can use the sort-by options below to view bills in different ways.

  issues:
    index:
      intro: |
        This is a list of all issue areas -- here referred to as "subjects" -- for legislation in the Texas state legislature. State legislatures generate many thousands of subjects every regular session and officially assign them to individual legislative items -- sometimes many subjects per bill, sometimes zero. <br><br> To make this bill-to-issue system more intelligible, the first list below is the 46 major legislative issue areas as determined by the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a>. With volunteer <a href="/pages/help">help</a>, we seek to manually match every official bill subject to one of the below 46 issue areas. The resulting info on OpenGovernment will make it far easier to find bills that are relevant to the real-world political issues you care about. Until that project is completed, below that list on this page is displayed the most-frequent bill subjects in Texas, those that are applied to bills ten or more times. Click the link to "view all" subjects to see the full list of many thousands of individual, idiosyncratic bill subjects and their associated bills.<br><br>
        The next Texas legislature will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which date new bills will be introduced and appear here automatically under our customized issue area categories. Until then, use the sort-by options below to view issues and bills from the most recent legislature in different ways.

      intro: |
        This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the TX state
        legislature. Data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
        agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports. The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
        makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, issue areas, and campaign contributions in state legislatures.<br>
        The next election for the Texas legislature (for all 150 Assemblymembers and half of the 32 Senators) will occur on Nov. 2, 2010.
        The newly-elected legislature will convene on Jan. 11, 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
        contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from this session by viewing the three tiers of contributions listed below: sectors,
        industries, and businesses. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics.
