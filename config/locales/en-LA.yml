        <em>Editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now, some official video for legislation in Louisana is available on two video sites for the state <a href="http://house.legis.state.la.us/H_Video/Hse_Video_OnDemand.htm" target="_blank">House of Representatives</a> (including, to their credit, a <a href="http://rss.icerocket.com/xmlfeed?id=1294">video RSS feed</a> in the open XML standard, bravo) and <a href="http://senate.legis.state.la.us/video" target="_blank">Senate</a> (no feed found, unfortunately). But clearly, the design of these video sites is un-user-friendly. The House makes video available via an un-user-friendly website in the obscure .asx video format. The Senate still uses a closed format for its video files: "We recommend using Windows Media Player...". In brief, the Louisiana legislature is far, far behind technical best practices in publishing and displaying online video for the public.

        This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Louisiana state
                          legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                          agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                          The newly-elected Louisiana legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                          contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                         <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.<br><br> The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
                            makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.
