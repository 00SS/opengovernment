          How did we get the above information? Well, the Louisiana legislature does not make its data available in ways that are fully open, but we worked around it. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

        The Louisiana session is scheduled to being on April 25th, 2011, so there are no bills here yet. You may <a href="/sessions/2009/bills">browse the previous session's bills instead</a> -- for example, bills <a href="http://la.opengovernment.org/sessions/2009/bills?sort=mentions">most in the news</a> last year, or those rated <a href="http://la.opengovernment.org/sessions/2009/bills?sort=keyvotes">key votes</a> by Project VoteSmart.

        <em>Editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now, some official video for legislation in Louisana is available on two video sites for the state <a href="http://house.legis.state.la.us/H_Video/Hse_Video_OnDemand.htm" target="_blank">House of Representatives</a> (including, to their credit, a <a href="http://rss.icerocket.com/xmlfeed?id=1294">video RSS feed</a> in the open XML standard, bravo) and <a href="http://senate.legis.state.la.us/video" target="_blank">Senate</a> (no feed found, unfortunately). But clearly, the design of these video sites is un-user-friendly. The House makes video available via an un-user-friendly website in the obscure .asx video format. The Senate still uses a closed format for its video files: "We recommend using Windows Media Player...". In brief, the Louisiana legislature is far, far behind technical best practices in publishing and displaying online video for the public.
