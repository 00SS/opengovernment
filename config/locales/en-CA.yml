        ... this free public resource is still in early development. You can help us find lots of different information to display here for the public benefit -- <strong><a href="/pages/help">help us grow</a></strong>.<br><br>
        How did we get the above information? Well, almost no U.S. legislature (including California) makes its data available in ways that are fully open, so we had to work around them. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

        <em>California- editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now, as of this writing: the most-central repository of official online video for bills in the CA state legislature of which we're aware is <a href="https://www.calchannel.com/" target="_blank">CalChannel</a>, but they do not make their video available in ways that are <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/">fully open</a>. So at the moment, a fair amount of research and digging is still required to access video content relevant to this bill and bills in general. But they do have some decent offerings in streaming Flash video from both chambers of the legislature, it would seem, via their customized WordPress installation.
