        How did we get the above information? Well, the California legislature does not make its data available in ways that are fully open, but we worked around it. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

        <em>California- editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now, as of this writing: the most-central repository of official online video for bills in the CA state legislature of which we're aware is <a href="https://www.calchannel.com/" target="_blank">CalChannel</a>, but they do not make their video available in ways that are <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/">fully open</a>. So at the moment, a fair amount of research and digging is still required to access video content relevant to this bill and bills in general. But they do have some decent offerings in streaming Flash video from both chambers of the legislature, it would seem, via their customized WordPress installation.

          This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the California state
                  legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                  agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
          The Money Trail makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this information proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and elected officials to mandate timely financial disclosure, strong ethics laws, and comprehensive electoral reform for fair elections in order to establish a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.<br><br>
                  The newly-elected CA legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                  contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                 <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.
