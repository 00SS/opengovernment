        ... this free public resource is still in early development. You can help us find lots of different information to display here for the public benefit -- <strong><a href="/pages/help">help us grow</a></strong>.<br><br>
        How did we get the above information? Well, almost no U.S. legislature (including California) makes its data available in ways that are fully open, so we had to work around them. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

        <em>California- editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now, as of this writing: the most-central repository of official online video for bills in the CA state legislature of which we're aware is <a href="https://www.calchannel.com/" target="_blank">CalChannel</a>, but they do not make their video available in ways that are <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/">fully open</a>. So at the moment, a fair amount of research and digging is still required to access video content relevant to this bill and bills in general. But they do have some decent offerings in streaming Flash video from both chambers of the legislature, it would seem, via their customized WordPress installation.

          This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the California state
                  legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                  agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
          The Money Trail makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations. This open resource is intended to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics and mitigate systemic corruption in state government. There are three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>, <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.
