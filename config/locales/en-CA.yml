        The bill "subjects" below are officially assigned to legislation by the California state legislature. Individual subjects can be very broad, or very specific, and are applied to bills using an unclear methodology -- sometimes more than a dozen subjects per bill, sometimes none.<br><br>
        In the future, to make bills in California more intelligible, we seek to map every subject to one of the 46 legislative issue areas defined by the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a> -- read more about <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>. Until then, below we're displaying the most-frequently used subjects in the California legislature, those applied to bills ten times or more.<br><br>                
        The next California legislature will convene in January 2011, after which date new subjects will be introduced and appear here automatically as they are applied to bills.

          This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the California state
                  legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                  agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                  The newly-elected CA legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                  contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                 <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.<br><br> The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
                    makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.
