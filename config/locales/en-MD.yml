        <em>Editorial note</em>: as far as what's out there now, as of this writing: there is no official site of online video for bills in the Maryland state legislature of which we're aware, but they do make <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/asp/listen.asp" target="_blank">audio</a> available online via an almost-marvelously behind-the-times webpage. So at the moment, a lot of digging and research is still required to find video of MD legislative proceedings, e.g. committee hearings and votes. What a shortcoming. '

      intro: |
       The bill "subjects" below are officially assigned to legislation by the Maryland state legislature. Individual subjects are sometimes very broad and other times very specific, and there is no predictable methodology by which they are applied to bills.<br><br>
       In the future, to make political issues in Maryland more intelligible, we seek to map every bill subject to one of the 46 legislative issue areas defined by the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a> -- read more about <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>. Until then, below we're displaying the most-frequently used subjects in the Maryland legislature -- those applied to bills four times or more -- with a link at the bottom of the page to "View All".<br><br>                
       <em>(The next Maryland legislature will convene in January 2011, after which date new subjects will be introduced and appear here automatically as they are applied to bills.)</em>

      intro: |
       This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Maryland state
                 legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                 agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                 The newly-elected Maryland legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                 contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.<br><br> The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
                   makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.
