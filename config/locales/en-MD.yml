          How did we get the above information? Well, the Maryland legislature does not make its data available in ways that are fully open, but we worked around it. Read more <a href="/pages/about/#our_data_sources">about our data sources</a>.

       This page lists all publicly-available information about campaign contributions made to members of the Maryland state
                 legislature. All data comes from the non-partisan <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, which receives its data from the state disclosure
                 agencies with which candidates must file their campaign finance reports.<br><br>
                 The newly-elected Maryland legislature will convene in January 2011, after which time up-to-date campaign
                 contribution info will appear here as soon as it's available. Until then, you can follow the Money Trail from the last legislature by viewing the three tiers of contributors listed below: <em>sectors</em>,
                <em>industries</em>, and <em>businesses</em>.<br><br> The Money Trail on OpenGovernment
                   makes it possible to connect the dots between bills, key votes, and campaign donations in state legislatures. We hope this page proves useful for political bloggers, issue-based groups, and citizen watchdogs to build public knowledge about the pervasive role of money in politics. In addition, we hope this information motivates citizens and members of the legislature to mandate real-time financial disclosure and fair elections for a trustworthy degree of transparency in government.
