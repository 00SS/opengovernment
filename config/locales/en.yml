        <br>OpenGovernment is free and non-partisan public resource for government transparency. Finally, a version of OpenCongress.org for [state].<br><br>
        We combine official government information with news coverage, blog posts, campaign contributions, and more to make bills easier to understand. Find, track, and share everything in the %{legislature_name}.

        We believe it is important for the public to be able to easily access information about which special interest groups support or oppose this legislation with their campaign contributions. Unfortunately, state governments do not disclose contribution data in ways that are sufficiently timely or fully open. As a result, the process of finding out which entities support and oppose this bill is more difficult and time-intensive than it needs to be... and the public is kept in the dark about the systemic influence of money in the political process, usually until after key votes are already cast.<br><br>
        In the future, our goal is to work with our data partners for campaign contribution information -- the <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/" target="_blank">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a> and <a href="http://maplight.org/" target="_blank">MAPLight</a>, both non-profit and non-partisan organizations -- to create more versions of state-level transparency sites like <strong><a href="http://maplight.org/california" target="_blank">MAPLight California</a></strong>. In addition, we seek open-source volunteer programming time and non-profit funding support to link state-level elected officials with the rich open data sets at an allied non-profit project, <a href="http://littlesis.org/" target="_blanks">LittleSis.org</a>, building "a free database detailing the connections between powerful people and organizations."<br><br>

Until then, see <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a> support our work and get this vital data -- on which special interest groups are supporting and opposing individual bills in state legislatures via their political donations -- in place.

      title: 'Issue Areas in the %{legislature_name}'
      intro: |
        The %{legislature_name} officially assigns issue areas to legislation. Generally speaking, though, the bill-to-issue mapping used by the 50 U.S. state legislatures are unstandardized and byzantine. Below we're showing the issue areas used most frequently in this state, those assigned to bills four or more times. Click the link at the bottom of the page to view all of the many thousands of bill subjects -- some very specific, others very broad.<br><br>
        Our goal is to make arcane bills easier to find and follow through the issue areas that the public already knows. Towards this end, we seek non-profit funding support to manually assign the most-viewed bills in this state to one or more of the 46 legislative issue areas as determined by the non-partisan <a href="http://votesmart.org/issue_rating.php" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a> -- read <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>.
