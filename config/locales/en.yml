        <br>OpenGovernment is free and non-partisan public resource for government transparency. Finally, a version of OpenCongress.org for state legislatures.<br><br>
        We combine official government information with news coverage, blog posts, campaign contributions, and more to make bills easier to understand. Find, track, and share everything in the legislature.

        We believe it is important for the public to be able to easily access information about which special interest groups support or oppose this legislation with their campaign contributions. Unfortunately, state governments do not disclose contribution data in ways that are sufficiently timely or fully open. As a result, the process of finding out which entities support and oppose this bill is more difficult and time-intensive than it needs to be... and the public is kept in the dark about the systemic influence of money in the political process, usually until after key votes are already cast.<br><br>
        In the future, our goal is to work with our data partners for campaign contribution information -- the <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/" target="_blank">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a> and <a href="http://maplight.org/" target="_blank">MAPLight</a>, both non-profit and non-partisan organizations -- to create more versions of state-level transparency sites like <strong><a href="http://maplight.org/california" target="_blank">MAPLight California</a></strong>. In addition, we seek open-source volunteer programming time and non-profit funding support to link state-level elected officials with the rich open data sets at an allied non-profit project, <a href="http://littlesis.org/" target="_blanks">LittleSis.org</a>, building "a free database detailing the connections between powerful people and organizations."<br><br>

Until then, see <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a> support our work and get this vital data -- on which special interest groups are supporting and opposing individual bills in state legislatures via their political donations -- in place.

        The %{legislature_name} officially assigns issue areas to legislation. Generally speaking, though, this system is difficult to navigate -- there are many thousands of unstandardized issues per legislature, and they're discouragingly byzantine.<br><br> To make issue areas more widely intelligible, our legislative data source the <a href="http://openstates.sunlightlabs.com/" target="_blank">Open States Project</a> has mapped individual bill subject areas to one of 44 master issue areas. Below we're showing the master issue areas that have at least one bill assigned to them in the current legislature.
