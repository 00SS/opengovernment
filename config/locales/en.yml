      details: |
        We believe it is important for the public to be able to easily access information about which special interest groups support or oppose this legislation with their campaign contributions. Unfortunately, state governments do not disclose contribution data in ways that are sufficiently timely or fully open. As a result, the process of finding out which entities support and oppose this bill is more difficult and time-intensive than it needs to be... and the public is kept in the dark about the systemic influence of money in the political process, usually until after key votes are already cast.<br><br>
        In the future, our goal is to work with our data partners for campaign contribution information -- the <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/" target="_blank">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a> and <a href="http://maplight.org/" target="_blank">MAPLight</a>, both non-profit and non-partisan organizations -- to create more versions of state-level transparency sites like <strong><a href="http://maplight.org/california" target="_blank">MAPLight California</a></strong>. In addition, we seek open-source volunteer programming time and non-profit funding support to link state-level elected officials with the rich open data sets at an allied non-profit project, <a href="http://littlesis.org/" target="_blanks">LittleSis.org</a>, building "a free database detailing the connections between powerful people and organizations."<br><br>
        For now, see <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a> support our work and get this vital data -- on which special interest groups are supporting and opposing individual bills in state legislatures via their political donations -- in place for the public benefit on the open Web.

      major_action: |
        A major action for a bill, as we define it, includes either movement between committees or roll call vote
        on final passage. It is intended to serve as a lower-traffic and more-intelligible stream of updates on
        this bill's status in the legislative process.

        We've done our best to optimize our Twitter search processes for this bill title, but occasionally even our state-of-the-art search robots bring in irrelevant Tweets, such as those including sports scores or similarly-titled bills from other geographic locations -- so if you see irrelevant Tweets below, please disregard them. Coming soon, we'll bring in mentions from other closed social media services like Facebook, open ones like Identi.ca and Diaspora, and more.

        At the moment, we're finding no news or blog mentions of this legislator, "%{search_term}", from our daily automated search of the Web (via Google News and Blog Search). But you can start building public knowledge here about this elected official and this state government.<br><br>
        If you can, publish a blog post that refers to this person by his title and full name as listed above, and if it's on the open Web where search engines can find it, a link to your post and an excerpt will automatically appear here within 24 hours. If you don't have access to a blog of your own, you can write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper or one of your state's political blogs, and if it's published on the Web, a link to that page will be swept up and displayed here.<br><br> 
        In order to build public knowledge about members of and candidates for state government, we need to publish our information & insights online in open standards -- i.e., not on password-protected proprietary services like Facebook or Twitter, but rather on the wide expanse of the searchable Web -- so that everyone can easily find information about this bill and learn what's really happening with it. There's lots more to do to make our government more open and accountable -- read more about <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>.
