  %p We believe that online video is a vitally important (and often overlooked) medium for tracking and understanding our government at every level. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of free and open video sources for official actions in state and city legislatures. State governments themselves do not make video streams of their proceedings available in ways that are fully open. While state government websites sometimes publish bits and pieces of video, there is no comprehensive and accessible solution for an average person to obtain video of all government actions, including important committee hearings, key vote proceedings in real-time, and more. Video coverage of state legislatures by political bloggers, issue-based organizations, and citizen watchdogs is often far-flung and difficult to search. 
  
  %p In the future, our goal is to aggregate useful video about every bill, issue, and member of your state government here, all freely-licensed and made available in open standards to share & remix -- see <a href="/pages/help" target="_blank">how you can help</a>. 
  
  %p Until then, we're using the free and open-source Miro Community software to create a crowdsourced hub of publicly-available video content for each state government. Head on over to see what's there and add videos of which you know for everyone to see on the open Web:
