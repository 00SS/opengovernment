        %p Well, no social media mentions found for this bill at this time. But hey, we can build on this. Here's what we do: using Twitter Search, we automatically search all publicly-available Tweets for citations of this bill by hashtag #txbill, combined with hashtag, for example, #hb1 or #sb362. Any matching results would be displayed below, but in their absence, there are a couple of likely reasons for this state of affairs that are worth mentioning. First, unfortunately, there are often not a lot of specific mentions of individual bills in state government out there on Twitter to be found -- i.e., we're starting with a deficit of attention and resources for legislation at the state and local levels. Second, some entities in state government such as issue-based groups or political reporters may be writing about this bill, but not on the Web where search engines can find their content. In order to build public knowledge about bills and issues in state government, then, we need to first publish them online in open standards -- i.e., not on password-protected proprietary services like Facebook or Twitter, but rather on the wide expanse of the searchable Web -- so that everyone can easily find information about this bill and learn what's really happening with it. As for what you can do, Tweet about this bill using hashtag #txbill and its number, e.g. #hb1 or #sb362, and a link to your update will automatically appear here within 24 hours or so for everyone to access. And that would be greatly helpful. There's lots more to do to make our government more open and accountable, e.g. with more resources we could do more to find mentions on more-or-less closed-off social networking services like Facebook -- read more about <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a>.
