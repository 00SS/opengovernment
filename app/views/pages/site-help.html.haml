- title("OpenGovernment - Help") 

%p Welcome to OpenGovernment, a public resource website for government transparency. Free and open-source. Non-profit and non-partisan. This site is run by a small team dedicated to comprehensive reform of our electoral systems and greater civic engagement with the political process... as such, we're easy to reach and happy to help. 

%p This beta version of OpenGovernment has information for five U.S. state legislatures: California, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, and Wisconsin. For each of those states, you can browse information as listed in the four major categories in the left-hand sidebar: Bills, People, Issues, and The Money Trail (campaign contributions). On those pages, you can browse legislative information by date, by most-viewed, by what's most in the news, and more.

%p Pages for individual bills and legislators, in turn, combine official government information with news coverage, blog posts, social media mentions, and more from around the open Web to make the legislative process more accessible. In addition, bill and people pages offer free tools to track official legislative actions, share them over social media with your community, and contact your elected officials. Read more <a href="/pages/about">about us</a>, <a href="/pages/about#our_data_sources">our data sources</a>, or <a href="/pages/about#how_to_use_og">ways you can use OpenGovernment</a>. 

%p Looking for your state on OpenGovernment, if it's not one of the five listed above? Unfortunately, it's not ready yet, but our open-source web development team is working hard every day to build it. Read more about <a href="/pages/help">how you can help</a> and speed along the process of rolling out OpenGovernment to all 50 U.S. states, major cities, and beyond. 

%p Looking for something in particular in those five states -- say, a bill in the news, or how to find and contact all your elected officials in those states? Try browsing from the state homepage, checking out the list of "key votes" under bills, or a search within your state of interest. 

%p If you still can't find what you're searching for on OpenGovernment, <a href="/pages/contact">contact us</a> with your question, and we'll do our best to help. We're a small non-profit team, easy to reach and interested in your feedback on this collaborative work-in-progress.
