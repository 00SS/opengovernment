%p 

%p OpenGovernment is a freeÂ and open-source public resource website for government transparency at the state and local levels. The site is a non-partisan joint project of two non-profit organizations, the <a href="http://www.participatorypolitics.org/">Participatory Politics Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, and is independent from any government entity, candidate for office, or political party.

%p OpenGovernment comes to you from the team that brought you OpenCongress.org, a leading web resource for civic engagement. Conceived in 2004, the main problem that OpenCongress sought to address was a lack of accessible information online about bills, votes, and issues in the U.S. Congress. The official website of Congress, Thomas.loc.gov, published raw data about legislation, but not in open data standards, not in timely ways, and not on webpages that were sufficiently user-friendly. (More than 15 years after Thomas' launch, it still doesn't come close to doing any of these things, which is unacceptable.)

%p OpenCongress addressed this problem, as much as possible given inherited technical limitations imposed by the data sources, by combining official government information with social wisdom from around the open Web. The resulting open-source software on OpenCongress enables individuals and organizations to track and share information about what's really happening in Congress through a user-friendly web application. Since its launch in 2007, OpenCongress has grown to become the most-visited government transparency website in the United States, and is proud to be an active contributor to a burgeoning ecosystem of open-government resources online. 

%p Writing in late 2010, the situation with official websites for U.S. state legislatures is nearly exactly as with Thomas in 2004. Unfortunately, almost no U.S. state government makes its data available in full online. Out of the 49 bicameral state legislatures in the U.S. and one unicameral body (Nebraska's), only one chamber -- one entity out of 99, namely the New York State Senate -- makes its legislative data available in ways that are sufficiently compliant with the community-generated 8 Principles of Open Government Data. Every other chamber of state government remains insistently closed-off from its constituents, refusing to release data (actions, votes, bill analysis -- don't even get us started on campaign contributions) online for all to see, despite the proven technical means to do so. And that's just to address the "defective by design" state of the back-end data that power what the public has the misfortune to occasionally try to encountner ... on the front-end, the status quo for state-level government web presences is a mishmash of non-standards-based, under-resourced, almost-hilariously poorly-designed websites that don't do nearly enough to informing the public at large. Public data can and should be public, immediately and in full, and it can and should be made accessible to everyone online, so as to increase trust and civic engagement in our representative democracy. 

%p OpenGovernment is a first step towards a solution. The ultimate mission of OpenGovernment is to achieve full public transparency in all three branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial) at every level of our representative democracy (federal, state, city, local, and more). In the shorter-term, OpenGovernment is basically a version of OpenCongress for state legislatures, in early open-source development. We cleaned-up the OC code base for OG, bringing over some parts and writing lots of new code, making it better-documented and more modular. We also simplified the web design and foregrounded more of our user-friendly participation tools along with our unique data offerings. We offer OpenGovernment to the public commons as a free, libre, and open-source model for open standards and future government transparency projects -- contributions warmly welcomed and remixes encouraged. 

%p As of October 2010, OpenGovernment has information for five state legislatures: California, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, and Wisconsin. (Why these five states? The shortest answer is: these data problems are gnarly to solve, and it made sense for technical reasons to start with these five, including two of the three biggest most-populous states in the country in CA and TX.) Over the course of the next year, we seek to roll out OpenGovernment to the remaining 45 U.S. state legislatures, and with additional resources, to more than a dozen major cities across the country. If you live in one of these five states, register a free account with OpenGovernment to get started and connect with your elected officials. If you don't live in one of these five states, you can still register a free account, as a version of OpenGovernment for your state is in the works and coming your way within a year -- <a href="/pages/help"> you can help</a> speed it along and make it better, and until then you can explore our current offerings.

%p Our Data Sources: 
%p 1. The primary source for all legislative information on OpenGovernment is the official state website, standardized and brought to OpenGovernment by the <a href=\"http://openstates.sunlightlabs.com/\">Open States Project</a> of Sunlight Labs and its volunteer community: bills, members, actions, votes, committees, and more. This data stream forms the legislative backbone of the site. 
%p 2. News and Blog coverage via Google News and Blog Search
%p 3. Campaign contribution data via Follow The Money -- and for CA, add'l data via MAPLight 
%p 4. Issue Areas, Issue Group Ratings, and official member contact information (where avail.) via Project VoteSmart. 
%p 5. Social Media mentions via the Twitter API, with more to come 
%p 6. Legislator bios via Wikipedia and "how state gov works" resources via Ballotpedia 
%p 7. Video - to be crowdsourced for each state on the Miro Community platform
%p 8. U.S. Congressional data from Thomas via GovTrack, via OpenCongress & the OG Community Project on the OC Wiki

%p Nothing short of full transparency is acceptable for a truly inclusive contemporary democracy. Even today, when technology gives us the ability to make all public data available to the public, contemporary American government remains largely closed-off from its constituents. The shortcomings are widespread among the three major levels of government: in Executive branches, data about public budgets and state spending are insufficiently disclosed; in Legislative branches, data about bills and the legislative process itself are insufficiently accessible; in Judicial branches, data about laws and statutes are insufficiently documented for the public at large. There's too much money in politics, and not enough transparency and ethics. As a result, trust in government institutions like the U.S. Congress is trending ever-lower, and voting rates are unacceptably depressed. As public opinion agency <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141512/Congress-Ranks-Last-Confidence-Institutions.aspx target="_new">Gallup</a> put it in July, the "2010 Confidence in Institutions poll finds Congress ranking dead last out of the 16 institutions rated this year. Eleven percent of Americans say they have 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in Congress, down from 17% in 2009 and a percentage point lower than the previous low for Congress, recorded in 2008."

%p If we were tasked with re-designing American democracy for the 21st century, we would revamp these arcane systems and bring them up to widely-accepted technical standards. Keeping in touch with your elected officials in government should be as easy as keeping in touch with friends on a social networking website such as Facebook. There's no compelling reason why this should not be the case unless you're a stakeholder in the status quo -- a lobbyist or a political insider or an elected official who depends on the system remaining "defective by design". Looking ahead, open-source software and the Internet (and libre data and flexible copyright licenses) give us the tools we need to make all public data available to the public, immediately and in full. Such a radical degree of transparency is first necessary in order to restore public trust in government and increase civic engagement. 

%p This trust and engagement, in turn, will create more opportunities and outlets for what we call "participatory politics" -- a universally-accessible, continually-engaged, meaningfully-reciprocal political process. In contrast to our current atrophied and closed-off democracy, an open government and a more deliberative democracy will result in better public policy outcomes, less systemic corruption, and comprehensive electoral reforms. These last planks are the necessary foundation, as we and many others see it, for our ultimate goals: stronger democratic institutions at home and abroad, a more fair society, and healthier living conditions in our real-world communities.

%p In our view, then, full transparency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for civic engagement. That is, transparency is a means to an end (of a more participatory politics for the public good) -- but nevertheless an important one, and an under-appreciated first step. Not to pull any punches here: we believe our current implementation of representative democracy is fundamentally broken. The degredation of our public sphere is exemplified best by our current captured government and the tidal wave of private money in the political process. Our experience with electing people to office is almost pitifully outdated: we shuffle off to shabby fixed booths in rigged Congressional districts to cast votes on a Tuesday every couple of years, most of us for one of two major parties, both of which solicit and compete for eye-popping amounts of corporate cash. The representatives we elect to craft our public policy operate in a legislative system fully compromised by lobbyists and the cross-pressures of special interests. The result of all these privations is a continually-declining faith in government, ignorance about political history, apathy about basic political change, and a malignant inability (i.e., refusal) to address pressing empirical problems such as, say, catastrophic climate change. Luckily, these days, open technology offers us a roadmap out of this captured-government gridlock and towards an accountable and responsive government.

%p In 2004, our non-profit organization, the Participatory Politics Foundation, conceived of OpenCongress.org, a free and open-source public resource for understanding and watchdogging the federal U.S. Congress. Since its launch in 2007, with the Sunlight Foundation as a primary and founding supporter, the site has grown to become the most-visited government transparency website in the U.S., and likely in the world. OpenCongress combines official government data with social wisdom from the open Web and participation tools in order to build public knowledge about Congress. Ever since we conceived of OpenCongress, we anticipated that the model of aggregating disparate data sources into a user-friendly web interface could be productively applied to other entities: state legislatures, city councils, neighborhood associations, international institutions, other branches of government (Executive and Judicial), public-mission institutions such as schools & hospitals, foreign countries with more-or-less democratic systems of governance, and more. We're working towards a future in which the public at large can conveniently access the best available info about all public actions at every level of government, then organize civic actions of their own in response to and in dialogue with their elected officials.

%p Towards this end, we created OpenGovernment, again with primary and founding support from our partners at the Sunlight Foundation. Like OpenCongress, OpenGovernment is a free, open-source, not-for-profit, and non-partisan web resource. More specifically, we're working with the staff at Sunlight Labs and many volunteers on the community-driven Open States Project, with the goal of establishing a data standard and collecting machine-readable data streams for all 50 U.S. State Legislatures. These data streams will provide official government info to GovKit, the open-source application that combines it with other publicly-available data sources and social wisdom from around the open Web. GovKit, in turn, will power the OpenGovernment website: essentially, free and non-partisan versions of OpenCongress for all fifty state legislatures and a dozen major cities, with even more local versions planned. We'll continue to encourage volunteers to remix the code for city, county, or municipal governments. Along the way, we've made our code more modular and better-documented, in order to make it possible for volunteers to make their own versions of OpenGovernment with an emphasis on the issues they and their communities care about.

%p Our code has always been 100% open, but now we have an even better answer to the question, "How do I make an OpenCongress for my (state, city, town, or country)?" OpenGovernment is the new solution. Overall, we have a good start on a more transparent government, but we've just begun -- we need more resources to take OpenGovernment to the next level and enable more powerful civic engagement.
