- title("About OpenGovernment.org")

%p The ultimate mission of OpenGovernment is to achieve full public transparency in all three branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial) at every level of our representative democracy (federal, state, city, local, and more).

%p Nothing short of full transparency is acceptable for a truly inclusive contemporary democracy. Even today, when technology gives us the ability to make all public data available to the public, contemporary American government remains largely closed-off from its constituents. The shortcomings are widespread among the three major levels of government: in Executive branches, data about public budgets and state spending are insufficiently disclosed; in Legislative branches, data about bills and the legislative process itself are insufficiently accessible; in Judicial branches, data about laws and statutes are insufficiently documented for the public at large. There's too much money in politics, and not enough transparency and ethics. As a result, trust in government institutions like the U.S. Congress is trending ever-lower, and voting rates are unacceptably depressed. As public opinion agency <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141512/Congress-Ranks-Last-Confidence-Institutions.aspx target="_new">Gallup</a> put it in July, the "2010 Confidence in Institutions poll finds Congress ranking dead last out of the 16 institutions rated this year. Eleven percent of Americans say they have 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in Congress, down from 17% in 2009 and a percentage point lower than the previous low for Congress, recorded in 2008."

%p If we were tasked with re-designing American democracy for the 21st century, we would revamp these arcane systems and bring them up to widely-accepted technical standards. Keeping in touch with your elected officials in government should be as easy as keeping in touch with friends on a social networking website such as Facebook. There's no compelling reason why this should not be the case unless you're a stakeholder in the status quo -- a lobbyist or a political insider or an elected official who depends on the system remaining "defective by design". Looking ahead, open-source software and the Internet (and libre data and flexible copyright licenses) give us the tools we need to make all public data available to the public, immediately and in full. Such a radical degree of transparency is first necessary in order to restore public trust in government and increase civic engagement. 

%p This trust and engagement, in turn, will create more opportunities and outlets for what we call "participatory politics" -- a universally-accessible, continually-engaged, meaningfully-reciprocal political process. In contrast to our current atrophied and closed-off democracy, an open government and a more deliberative democracy will result in better public policy outcomes, less systemic corruption, and comprehensive electoral reforms. These last planks are the necessary foundation, as we and many others see it, for our ultimate goals: stronger democratic institutions at home and abroad, a more fair society, and healthier living conditions in our real-world communities.

%p In our view, then, full transparency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for civic engagement. That is, transparency is a means to an end (of a more participatory politics for the public good) -- but nevertheless an important one, and an under-appreciated first step. Not to pull any punches here: we believe our current implementation of representative democracy is fundamentally broken. The degredation of our public sphere is exemplified best by our current captured government and the tidal wave of private money in the political process. Our experience with electing people to office is almost pitifully outdated: we shuffle off to shabby fixed booths in rigged Congressional districts to cast votes on a Tuesday every couple of years, most of us for one of two major parties, both of which solicit and compete for eye-popping amounts of corporate cash. The representatives we elect to craft our public policy operate in a legislative system fully compromised by lobbyists and the cross-pressures of special interests. The result of all these privations is a continually-declining faith in government, ignorance about political history, apathy about basic political change, and a malignant inability (i.e., refusal) to address pressing empirical problems such as, say, catastrophic climate change. Luckily, these days, open technology offers us a roadmap out of this captured-government gridlock and towards an accountable and responsive government.

%p In 2004, our non-profit organization, the Participatory Politics Foundation, conceived of OpenCongress.org, a free and open-source public resource for understanding and watchdogging the federal U.S. Congress. Since its launch in 2007, with the Sunlight Foundation as a primary and founding supporter, the site has grown to become the most-visited government transparency website in the U.S., and likely in the world. OpenCongress combines official government data with social wisdom from the open Web and participation tools in order to build public knowledge about Congress. Ever since we conceived of OpenCongress, we anticipated that the model of aggregating disparate data sources into a user-friendly web interface could be productively applied to other entities: state legislatures, city councils, neighborhood associations, international institutions, other branches of government (Executive and Judicial), public-mission institutions such as schools & hospitals, foreign countries with more-or-less democratic systems of governance, and more. We're working towards a future in which the public at large can conveniently access the best available info about all public actions at every level of government, then organize civic actions of their own in response to and in dialogue with their elected officials.

%p Towards this end, we created OpenGovernment, again with primary and founding support from our partners at the Sunlight Foundation. Like OpenCongress, OpenGovernment is a free, open-source, not-for-profit, and non-partisan web resource. More specifically, we're working with the staff at Sunlight Labs and many volunteers on the community-driven Open States Project, with the goal of establishing a data standard and collecting machine-readable data streams for all 50 U.S. State Legislatures. These data streams will provide official government info to GovKit, the open-source application that combines it with other publicly-available data sources and social wisdom from around the open Web. GovKit, in turn, will power the OpenGovernment website: essentially, free and non-partisan versions of OpenCongress for all fifty state legislatures and a dozen major cities, with even more local versions planned. We'll continue to encourage volunteers to remix the code for city, county, or municipal governments. Along the way, we've made our code more modular and better-documented, in order to make it possible for volunteers to make their own versions of OpenGovernment with an emphasis on the issues they and their communities care about.

%p Our code has always been 100% open, but now we have an even better answer to the question, "How do I make an OpenCongress for my (state, city, town, or country)?" OpenGovernment is the new solution. Overall, we have a good start on a more transparent government, but we've just begun -- we need more resources to take OpenGovernment to the next level and enable more powerful civic engagement.
