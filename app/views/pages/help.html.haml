- title("Help Us Open Government")

%p OpenGovernment is a free, open-source, non-profit, and non-partisan project in early development. It's based on OpenCongress, the most-visited government transparency website in the United States.

%p We've started with the legislatures of five states: California, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, and Wisconsin. And we have a good start, but we need more resources to roll out OpenGovernment to all 45 U.S. states, cities, and more. 

%p Want to see a version of OpenGovernment for your state and city, and make this free public resource even better?  <strong>Help us grow!</strong> 

%p First, <strong><a href="http://crm.ppolitics.org/">join our e-mail list</a></strong> to stay in touch. We'll e-mail you about once a month with site updates as we work to take OpenGovernment national. 

%p Second, <strong>follow us</strong> on <a href="http://twitter.com/open_gov" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (or <a href="http://identi.ca/opengovernment" target="_blank">Identi.ca</a>) and join us on the <a href="http://identi.ca/opengovernment" target="_blank">OpenCongress Facebook Group</a> (and coming soon, <a href="http://www.joindiaspora.com/" target="_blank">Diaspora</a>) to build our open community. 

%p Third, support OpenGovernment by making a <strong>tax-exempt donation</strong> to our 501(c)3 non-profit organization: <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/donate" target="_blank">donate via OpenCongress</a>. Your donation helps us add valuable new data sources, important new site features, and most importantly, speeds up our ability to bring fully-grown versions of OpenGovernment to your state and city. 

%p <!If you're a strong believer in our mission, sign up to be an OG Booster. Boosters are members who contribute one dollar per day to support our open-source development. Once we reach at least 100 OG Boosters per month, we can contract with a professional non-profit fundraiser to raise more money to hire more programmers to liberate more government data for everyone on the open Web.-->

%p <strong>Charitable foundations</strong>, issue-based organizations, philanthropists: we are actively seeking funding partners to develop OpenGovernment and make it a must-have tool for public education, independent media, local community groups, and more. Please <a href="/pages/contact">contact us</a> to obtain a copy of our non-profit OpenGovernment fundraising prospectus and to start a conversation about our vision of civic engagement through open-source software and Web tools.
