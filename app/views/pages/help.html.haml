- title("About OpenGovernment.org")

%p OpenGovernment is a free, open-source, non-profit, and non-partisan project in early development. It's based on OpenCongress, the most-visited government transparency website in the United States.

%p We've started with the legislatures of five states: California, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, and Wisconsin. And we have a good start, but we need more resources to roll out OpenGovernment to all 45 U.S. states, cities, and more. 

%p Want to see a version of OpenGovernment for your state and city, and make this free public resource even better?  <strong>Help us grow!</strong> 

%p First, <strong>join our e-mail list</strong> to stay in touch. We'll e-mail you about once a month with site updates as we work to take OpenGovernment national: 

%p Second, <strong>follow us</strong> on Twitter (or Identi.ca) and join us on Facebook (and coming soon, Diaspora) to build our open community. 

%p Third, support OpenGovernment by making a <strong>tax-exempt donation</strong> to our 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Your donation helps us add valuable new data sources, important new site features, and most importantly, speeds up our ability to bring a fully-grown version of OpenGovernment to your state and city. 

%p If you're a strong believer in our mission, sign up to be an <strong>OG Booster</strong>. Boosters are members who contribute one dollar per day to support our open-source development. Once we reach at least 100 OG Boosters per month, we can contract with a professional non-profit fundraiser to raise more money to hire more programmers to liberate more government data for everyone on the open Web. 

%p <strong>Charitable foundations</strong>, issue-based organizations, philanthropists: we are actively seeking funding partners to develop OpenGovernment and make it a must-have tool for public education, independent media, local community groups, and more. Please <a href="/pages/contact">contact us</a> for our non-profit fundraising prospectus and to start a conversation about our vision of civic engagement through open-source software and Web tools.  

%p Last, sign up as an <strong>OG volunteer</strong> -- head over to our <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/project/opengovernment-needs-open-data" target="_blank">Drumbeat project page</a> and click the button to "join this project" (it's free and takes just a minute). There, you can help us find the following much-needed info for elected officials across the country (maybe even yours): social media accounts, public event schedules, video footage, scorecards from watchdog groups, and more.

%p We're a tiny non-profit team making big (free and open-source) things, and we have big plans for OpenGovernment. In the best tradition of transparency and accessibility, we invite you to </strong><a href="/pages/contact">contact us</a></strong> and let us know what you think.
