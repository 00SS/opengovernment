- title("Help Us Open Government")

%p OpenGovernment is a free, open-source, non-profit, and non-partisan web project in early development. It's based on OpenCongress, the most-visited government transparency website in the United States. 

%p This beta version of the site connects you with five state legislatures: California, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, and Wisconsin. And we have a good start, but we need more resources to roll out OpenGovernment to all 50 U.S. states and beyond.  

%p Want to see a version of OpenGovernment for your state and city, and make this free public resource even better?  <strong>Help us grow!</strong>

%p <!If you're a strong believer in our mission, sign up to be an OG Booster. Boosters are members who contribute one dollar per day to support our open-source development. Once we reach at least 100 OG Boosters per month, we can contract with a professional non-profit fundraiser to raise more money to hire more programmers to liberate more government data for everyone on the open Web.-->
